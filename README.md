###Base Thermostat

**holdtemp.py** - python script reading temperature from ADC, then turning relay on or off based on the temperature threshold in /run/lock/set-temp.txt. Writes current temp to /run/lock/current-temp.txt

**restart-holdtemp.sh** - shell script to kill holdtemp if it hangs (and does not update current-temp.txt for 2 minutes)

**settemp.sh** - shell script that sets set-temp.txt - runs from cron. Ignores the setting if the file /run/lock/schedule-status.txt is not present, this is used to disable scheduled operation while leaving schedule settings in place

###Web-based Controls

**/var/www/thermostat** - contains php scripts for reading and writing crontable and current-temp, as well as html, css, fonts and javascript to display web ui. The UI can be used from any browser, e.g. from a phone

###Screen

**runkiosk.sh** - script to launch X11 GUI, with Chromium browser in kiosk mode pointing to the web-based thermostat user interface URL (http://localhost)

###Dimmer

**dimmer.py** - script that reads light sensor and sets PWM pulse width that adjusts screen backlight

Requires pigpiod to be installed and running
